        \begin{rSubsection}{University of Manchester}{September 2020 - September 2024}{PhD Projects}{Manchester, UK}
            \item   Supervised by Prof. Terry Wyatt FRS. 
            \item   Proposed, developed, implemented, and tested improved methods to identify the highly boosted pair production of the $\tau$ leptons in the lep-had channels---the electron-removal $\tau_\mathrm{had}$ and the muon-removal $\tau_\mathrm{had}$ reconstruction applied in Athena.
            \item   Algorithms went through strict scrutiny, now running in Tier-0 ATLAS data processing system. These methods have been
                adopted by the ATLAS collaboration as the recommanded taggers for boosted $\tau_\mathrm{lep}\tau_\mathrm{had}$ identification.
            \item   The muon-removal $\tau_\mathrm{had}$ technique has been benchmarked with data, achieving a three-~to~five-fold 
                improvement in the signal efficiency and signal-to-background ratio. Paper published by EPJC.
